We will use Hyperledger Fabric to build a secure and decentralized database for patient records and data.  This will allow us to build a permissioned blockchain networks through chaincode that will carry the rules and logic of the data stored on chain so that only authorized parties can access and modify the data.

We will design the network architecture, including the number of nodes and the communication channels between them. The nodes will be hosted by different healthcare organizations or stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Once we do this, we will configure the access control policies using chaincode samples from the Hyperledger library to develop identity and access management features.

We will test the network to ensure that it works as expected and can handle the expected volume of transactions. Use test data to simulate different scenarios and ensure that the smart contracts and network architecture are working as intended. Once the network has been tested and validated, deploy it in a production environment. Ensure that all participants have the necessary access rights and permissions to use the network. Access, data storage and votes on the Cura data base, and CUra Dao respectively will be set up on this protocol.

For now, we have built an ERC-20 token lodged on the Ethereum network which will act as a reward token, the CuraCoin. This is basically a token that proves membership and transfers access to any monetary rewards resulting from participating in the CuraDAO. In the interest of time, weâ€™ve built this token but at a later date we will build the architecture for our data base using the DLT protocols set forth above.

We will also use HiFi protocol to facilitate communications between DAO members and to foster collaboration.
