We will use Hyperledger Fabric to build a secure and decentralized database for patient records and data.  This will allow us to build a permissioned blockchain networks through chaincode that will carry the rules and logic of the data stored on chain so that only authorized parties can access and modify the data.

We will design the network architecture, including the number of nodes and the communication channels between them. The nodes will be hosted by different healthcare organizations or stakeholders in the healthcare industry. Once we do this, access to control policies can be configured using chaincode samples from the Hyperledger library to develop identity and access management features. 

Code samples for starting to build this on the secure chain will be built as in the example repo here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.

We will test the network to ensure that it works as expected and can handle the expected volume of transactions. Use test data to simulate different scenarios and ensure that the smart contracts and network architecture are working as intended. Once the network has been tested and validated, deploy it in a production environment. Ensure that all participants have the necessary access rights and permissions to use the network. Access, data storage and votes on the Cura data base, and CUra Dao respectively will be set up on this protocol.



# Code for this hackathon 

For now, we have built an ERC-20 token lodged on the Ethereum network which will act as a reward token, the CuraCoin. This is basically a token that proves unique identity of the data sharer, membership to the CuraDAO and transfers access to any monetary rewards resulting from participating in the CuraDAO. In the interest of time, weâ€™ve built this token but at a later date we will build the architecture for our data base using the DLT protocols set forth above.

We will also use HiFi protocol to facilitate communications between DAO members and to foster collaboration in the NFT marketplace. 
Molecule.to has been developing IP-NFTs for deSci projects. These need to be expanded and adapted for data or IP related to the datasets used in the research.

A major part of this reward token for sharing data is also to get rewarded from the token value of the overall IP from drug discovery and scientific process. Some ideas for this are as follows. 

# Ideas for IP-NFT Pool Integration 

ere are a few ideas for pool integration:

Staking rewards: Introduce a staking mechanism where users can stake their Pool Tokens to earn rewards, such as additional Pool Tokens or other tokens. This can encourage users to participate in the ecosystem and retain their Pool Tokens.

Governance rights: Grant Pool Token holders governance rights over certain decisions within the DataVerse ecosystem, such as upgrades to the smart contract, future feature development, or changes in the reward distribution model. This way, users will be more incentivized to hold Pool Tokens, as they have a say in the project's direction.

Exclusive content or services: Offer exclusive content or services to Pool Token holders, such as premium data storage options, discounted fees, or priority access to new features. This can incentivize users to acquire and hold Pool Tokens to access these benefits.

Partner collaborations: Collaborate with other projects in the NFT and DeFi space to offer additional benefits for Pool Token holders, such as discounts on partner platforms, exclusive access to partner events, or airdrops of partner tokens.

Token burns or buybacks: Implement a mechanism where a percentage of the fees generated by the platform is used to buy back and burn Pool Tokens or distribute them as rewards to Pool Token holders. This can create scarcity and potentially increase the value of the remaining Pool Tokens.

Data mining rewards: Incentivize users to contribute valuable data to the DataVerse ecosystem by offering rewards in the form of Pool Tokens or other tokens. This can encourage more users to store their data in DataVerse NFTs and participate in the pool.
